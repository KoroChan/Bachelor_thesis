Distributed Learning of Pedestrian Behaviour by Wireless Sensor Networks Towards a Scheme of Opportunistic Data Collection by Mobile Consumer Devices

This repository contains my Bachelor thesis in PDF, presentation slides that describe the basics of the project, and documented source code for the simulation experiments described in the manuscript.

My research included the development of a reinforcement learning algorithm for learning the times of pedestrian activity in the deployment area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This was towards a scheme of opportunistic data collection by mobile consumer devices, described in more detail in
